# FALCON-7B-instruct
1- The code installs necessary packages: transformers, accelerate, and einops.
2- It imports libraries such as transformers, torch, and AutoTokenizer.
3- A specific pre-trained language model ("tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct") is assigned to the variable "model."
4- An instance of AutoTokenizer is created using the specified model.
5- A text generation pipeline is created using transformers.pipeline(), specifying the task as "text-generation," the model, tokenizer, torch data type, and device map.
6- Prompts can be used as different pipelines such as Question answering, Summarization, Translation, Code completion, Chatbot.
7- The pipeline is called with the prompt, generating sequences based on the model and tokenizer.
8- The generated sequences are stored in the "sequences" variable.
9- A loop iterates over the sequences, printing the "generated_text" field of each sequence as the result.
